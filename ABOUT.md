I am considering web application with purpose of helping people to learn German language.

Target users are students, people who are interested in moving or just vistiting Germany, Austria and Switzerland, but this application can be used by anyone who in interested in learning Geman language.

Web app is considering to be a combination of language learning platform and website about German language in general.

Reasons I am interested in making language learning website is that similar software is expensive (Rosetta Stone , Pimsleur etc) and many web apps are offering only trial usage.

Also, in my country (Bosnia and Herzegovina) German language is second most popular foreign language (second to English) and it is taught in schools, and many people are talking about lack of free learning materials about this topic.

Content:

* Various multimedia content, primarily videos

* Articles about grammar, syntax and popular phrases.

* Interesting informations about Geman language (and languages in general)

* Some sort of a dictionary will be included

Collaboration

* links of other useful language learning tools

* share content with social network groups with similar interests

* Area where users can ask personal 1 on 1 classes with tutors and other students

Communication

* FAQ

* Forum, where users can discuss various topics with fellow learners and language teachers.
